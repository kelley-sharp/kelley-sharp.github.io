    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Coming from a small town just outside Wyoming, Tetonia, Idaho, my magnetism to growth and innovation has brought me to
      locations all around the world and the U.S., and finally to San Francisco. Possibility is my motivating force and uncertainty
      is what keeps me constantly adapting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pride myself most perhaps in my ability to not only listen to clients, but to hear them. Before I found my true calling
      in web development, I was on my way to becomming an occupational therapist. A role which provides tools for those in
      need of progressing toward their idea of optimal health, whatever that may be. Similarly I was able to discover the
      tool that would inspire my own personal fulfillment. I am truly in a position to help others now that I am doing work
      that works well for me, and I'm good at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a background in music, foreign language, health science, and psychology. Paired with my proficiency in computer programming,
      I'm confident I can provide you with a product that is performant, emotionally engaging, comprehensive, human, and
      effective in meeting your goals.
